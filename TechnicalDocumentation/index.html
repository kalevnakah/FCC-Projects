        <p>The Gospel or "The Good News" is something every christian is excited to share
          or at least should be excited to share. It's so simple, yet it's one of the hardest things to explain.
          This technical document is an attempt to break down the Gospel into it's simplest form
          and make the technical things a little easier to digest.
        </p>
        <code>John 3:16 = For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, 
          that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</code>
        <p>Yep! that's it. The entire bible boiled down to it's essence, the good news.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Bad News
            <P>- Where going to perish.</P></li>
          <li>The Good News
            <p>- Jesus can save us.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>In part one of this document we will break down the bad news.
          You can fully appreciate the good without knowing the bad.
          Maybe your life is awesome and pain free, 
          you may not believe that you need to be saved or that you will perish.</p>
        <p>In part two we will explain the good news. he truth is we all need to be saved.
          If not from the evil of the world, than maybe from ourselves.
        </p>
        <code>Jeremiah 17:9 = The heart is deceitful above all things
          and beyond cure.
          Who can understand it?</code>
        <p>Here we go!</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Genesis">
        <header>Genesis</header>
        <code>Genesis Chapter 1:1 = In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</code>
          <ul>
            <li>Day 1: Light & Darkness / Day & Night</li>
            <li>Day 2: The Sky</li>
            <li>Day 3: Land & Plants</li>
            <li>Day 4: Sun, Moon, Planets & Stars</li>
            <li>Day 5: Sea Creatures & Winged Creatures</li>
            <li>Day 6: Humans & Land Creatures</li>
            <li>Day 7: God rested</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Everything was perfect in the beginning. No evil. No Death. Just life.
          God but mankind in charge of everything of earth and gave him freedom.
          There was only one rule...</p>
        <code>Genesis 2:16 = And the Lord God commanded the man, 
          “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 
          but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, 
          for when you eat from it you will certainly die.”</code>
        <p>Adam and Eve broke this rule when they were deceived by the serpent, satan.
          Sin "separation of man and God", labor and birth pains, death and evil enter the world.
          From this point on every human being needs a savior from our sins, evil, pain, and death.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="The_Flood">
        <header>The Flood</header>
        <code>Genesis 6:11 = Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence. 
          12 God saw how corrupt the earth had become, 
          for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. 
          13 So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, 
          for the earth is filled with violence because of them. 
          I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.</code>
        <p>God makes up his mind to hit the reset button on the earth by 
          flooding the entire earth for 40 days and 40 nights. 
          Only Noah, his family and two of every kind of creature male and female were spared on a large boat.
          Why Noah?</p>
        <code>Genesis 6:8-9 = But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord...
          Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.</code>
        <p>An important note here... The redemption of man kind came only by blood of those who died in the flood.
          There is always a price to pay for the removal of sin. This is God's first attempt to make it right, 
          but the rebelliousness of humans to disobey God prevails.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Passover">
        <header>Passover</header>
        <p>Fast forward a bit and we find a the human race split between two kinds of people.</br>
          <li>Hebrews - The chosen people of God.</li>
          <li>Everybody Else "Pagans" - The people who don't follow God.</li></br>
          The Hebrews rebel and God allows them to become slaves of the Egyptians.
        </p>
        <p>God once again steps in to save the people that love him using his might and glory.
          After 400 years of affliction, God appoints Moses to lead his people to land they call home.
          Only one problem. Pharaoh "The powerful King of Egypt" doesn't want to loose his slave labor
          and refuses to let them leave. God inflicted them with ten plagues.</p>
        <code>Exodus 6:10-11 = Then the Lord said to Moses, 
          “Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.”</code>
        <ol>
          <li>Water turned to blood</li>
          <li>Frogs</li>
          <li>Gnats</li>
          <li>Flies</li>
          <li>Death of all the livestock</li>
          <li>Boils</li>
          <li>Hail Storm</li>
          <li>Locust</li>
          <li>Three days of darkness</li>
          <li>Death of the firstborn son</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After the tenth plague, Pharaoh did let the Hebrews leave. 
          The redemptive 10th plague once again required a sacrifice or a price.
          For the egyptians it was the blood of their first born son. 
          For the Hebrews it was the blood of a young male lamb without blemish.
          Make a mental note here, because this comes back into play later on in the second part.
          This day is celebrated to this day by Jews and Christians alike in remembrance
          of the deliverance and saving grace of God's mighty hand.</p>
